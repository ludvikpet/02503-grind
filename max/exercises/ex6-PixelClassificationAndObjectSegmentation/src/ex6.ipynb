In a CT image, the values are represented as [**Hounsfield units** (HU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hounsfield_scale). Hounsfield units are used in computed tomography to characterise the X-ray absorption of different tissues. A CT scanner is normally calibrated so a pixel with Hounsfield unit 0 has an absorbance equal to water and a pixel with Hounsfield unit -1000 has absorbance equal to air. Bone absorbs a lot of radiation and therefore have high HU values (300-800) and fat absorbs less radiation than water and has HU units around -100. Several organs have similar HU values since the soft-tissue composition of the organs have similar X-ray absorption. In the figure below (from Erich Krestel, \"Imaging Systems for Medical Diagnostics\", 1990, Siemens) some typical HU units for organs can be seen. They are, however, not always consistent from scanner to scanner and hospital to hospital. "
