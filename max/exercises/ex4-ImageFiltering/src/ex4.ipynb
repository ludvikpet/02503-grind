    "2. Use different border handling strategies when using filtering an image, including `constant` and `reflection`.\n",
    "3. Implement and apply a mean filter to an image. \n",
    "4. Implement and apply a median filter to an image (`skimage.filters.median`).\n",
    "5. Implement and apply a Gaussian filter to an image (`skimage.filters.gaussian`)\n",
    "5. Describe the effects of applying the mean, the Gaussian and the median filter to images containing Gaussian and outlier noise.\n",
    "6. Describe the concept on an image edge.\n",
