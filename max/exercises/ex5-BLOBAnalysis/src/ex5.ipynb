    "# Exercise 5 - BLOB Analysis (connected component analysis and object classification) \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this exercise is to implement, test and validate connected component analysis methods. Also known as BLOB (binary large object) analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The methods will be used to create a small program that can count cell nuclei.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this exercise, the student should be able to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Preprocess a colour image so it is suitable for BLOB analysis using color to gray transformations and threshold selection.\n",
    "2. Use slicing to extract regions of an image for further analysis.\n",
    "3. Use `segmentation.clear_border` to remove border BLOBs.\n",
    "4. Apply suitable morphological operations to remove small BLOBs, close holes and generally make a binary image suitable for BLOB analysis.\n",
    "5. Use `measure.label` to create labels from a binary image.\n",
    "6. Visualize labels using `label2rgb`.\n",
    "7. Compute BLOB features using `measure.regionprops` including BLOB area and perimeter.\n",
    "8. Remove BLOBs that have certain features.\n",
    "9. Extract BLOB features and plot feature spaces as for example area versus perimeter and area versus circularity.\n",
    "10. Choose a set of BLOB features that separates objects from noise.\n",
    "11. Implement and test a small program for cell nuclei classification and counting."
